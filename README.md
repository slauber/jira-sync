JIRA-sync is a nifty little tool to get a delta between a given (past) date and the current version of a JIRA Scrum Board.

Why do I need this?
-------------------
Are you a Scrum Master or someone who really tries to synchronize a JIRA board to a physical board? Don't get frustrated checking each card, use this tool to help you using your other tool. Like that [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) tells us: We value processes and tools over individuals and interactions. Or something similar.

How does it work?
-----------------
Sign in with your JIRA Credentials (they are not stored on the server, rather on the client in an encrypted Cookie), select a board and a date and get changes to update your physical board accordingly.
